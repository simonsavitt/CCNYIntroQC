# Computer Lab #3 - Grover Quantum Computation Lab

In this lab we'll be looking at amplitude amplification with Grover’s algorithm.  The relevant part of the book is section 8.2.

[Here’s what IBM has to say](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/grovers-algorithm) and [here’s another source for functioning code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-grovers-algorithm/).

Put together at least three different oracles (this is the hardest part) with search spaces of different sizes (the “N” from the book).
