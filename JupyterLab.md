# Intro to JupyterLab [WIP]
***

We will be using [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), a web-based editor for creating interactive notebooks using Markdown and Python. 
JupyterLab is the successor to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), which recently reached its sunset release (v7) and will not continue receiving upgrades.

It comes bundled with these libraries, several of which we'll be using: numpy, scipy, pandas, ipywidgets and matplotlib.
