# Intro to JupyterLab [WIP]
***

We will be using [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), a web-based editor for creating interactive notebooks using Markdown and Python. 
JupyterLab is the successor to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), which recently reached its sunset release (v7) and will not continue receiving upgrades. JupyterLab is also the [recommended development environment for Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#install-and-set-up-qiskit-with-the-qiskit-runtime-client).

There is a [JupyterLab desktop app](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) that simplifies the setup for us. Check out the README for installation instructions.
It comes bundled with some of the libraries we'll use, but we'll need to install others.

But in order to install the other libraries we'll be using

After opening JupyterLab Desktop, the welcome page comes up. We'll choose to start a `new session...` to use JupyterLab rather than Notebook.
We'll select the Python 3 (ipykernel) to use.

The `Anaconda Assistant` will appear on a tab to the right. 
You can receive 30 responses from the AI chatbot each day, which uses OpenAI as its backend. 
You can always switch to another AI chatbot if you max out.
