# Intro to JupyterLab [WIP]
***

We will be using JupyterLab, a web-based editor for creating interactive  notebooks using Markdown and Python. 

JupyterLab is the successor to Jupyter Notebook, which recently reached its sunset release (v7) and will not continue receiving upgrades.

Here are several cloud environments we can edit JupyterLab files on. 

anaconda.cloud
github.dev
vscode.dev
Google Colab
JupyterLite
