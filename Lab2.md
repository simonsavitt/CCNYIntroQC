# Computer Lab #2 - Deutsch-Jozsa Quantum Computation Lab [WIP]

In this lab we're doing the first quantum algorithm: Deutsch-Jozsa.  This is covered in sections 8.4 and 8.5 of the book.

[Here's how IBM does it](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms#the-deutsch-jozsa-algorithm) and [here's another decent discussion](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled/the-deutsch-jozsa-algorithm-math-circuits-and-code-quantum-algorithms-untangled-f3b28be4cfd3).

The trickiest part of this is setting up "the oracle".  For this project, set up three different versions of the D-J algorithm, starting with just two qubits (section 8.4) before doing two multi-qubit versions (8.5).
