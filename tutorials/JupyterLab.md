# Intro to JupyterLab [WIP]

We will be using [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), a web-based editor for creating interactive notebooks using Markdown and Python. 
JupyterLab is the successor to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), which recently reached its sunset release (v7) and will not continue receiving upgrades. JupyterLab is also the [recommended development environment for Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#install-and-set-up-qiskit-with-the-qiskit-runtime-client).

There is a [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) app that simplifies the setup for us. Check out the [README](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/blob/master/README.md) for installation instructions. If you have an existing JupyterLab Desktop installation, please uninstall it first by following the [uninstall instructions](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/blob/master/user-guide.md#uninstalling-jupyterlab-desktop). I recommend looking at the [User Guide](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/blob/master/user-guide.md) for an explanation of how the desktop app differs from the web app. For a tutorial on the user interface of JupyterLab, I recommend reading the [JupyterLab Tutorial by DataCamp](https://datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-jupyter-notebook).

Take a look at the [Sessions and Projects](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#sessions-and-projects) section on the JupyterLab Desktop repo. After opening JupyterLab Desktop, the welcome page comes up. We can either jump straight into a `new notebook...`, or start a `new session...` which opens the `Launcher` tab. From the `Launcher` we can open the `Console`, the `Terminal`, and `Show Contextual Help`, among other things. 

The [Anaconda Assistant](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda-notebooks/local-assistant/) will appear on a tab to the right. 
You can receive 30 responses from the AI chatbot each day, which uses OpenAI as its backend. 
But you can also install the [JupyterLab AI](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai) extension to use any AI backend you want!

On the bottom left of the welcome window you'll find your recent sessions.
